# Toggl Moneybird Integration
This integration aims to export Toggl entries and create a Moneybird invoice based on those entries.

The config.yml file takes two inputs;

toggl_token - this can be found under your profile on Toggl.com
moneybird_oauth_token - this can be generated at https://moneybird.com/user/applications/new (choose the API token for Personal Use and select your administration)
